# Forensic Value Analysis: Depo Auto Parts Industrial Co., Ltd. (6605.TW)

**Analyst:** Gemini 3 Flash (Himalaya Capital Methodology)  
**Status:** AUDIT GRADE  
**Date:** December 24, 2025

---

## STEP 1: PRE-QUALIFICATION (THE "TOO HARD" PILE)

- **Business Simplicity:** YES. Depo manufactures and sells automotive lamps and replacement parts for the aftermarket (AM). The revenue engine is simple: sell high-quality replacement lights to global repair shops and distributors.
- **Historical Profitability (FCF):** YES.  
  **Audit Trail (FCF NT$ M):**  
  - 2024: 4,710  
  - 2023: ~3,000  
  - 2022: ~2,600  
  - 2021: ~2,200  
  - 2020: ~2,100 [Cash Flow Tab]
- **Circle of Competence:** YES. Physical goods with trackable unit economics.  
- **Verdict:** **PROCEED TO ANALYSIS**

---

## STEP 2: THE MOAT & VIABILITY

- **The "10% Test" (Gross Margin Trends):** **EXPANDING**.  
  **Math:**  
  $2020 (24.22\%) \rightarrow 2021 (27.43\%) \rightarrow 2022 (29.63\%) \rightarrow 2023 (31.73\%) \rightarrow 2024 (34.07\%)$  
  **Result:** Significant evidence of pricing power or extreme manufacturing efficiency improvement.  
  [Financials Tab]

- **Switching Cost Evidence:** Psychological Brand & Certification. In the aftermarket industry, CAPA/NSF certifications act as high entry barriers. Depo’s brand is a global "gold standard" for non-OEM parts.

- **Disruption Risk:** LED/Smart Technology. Modern vehicles use complex LED matrices. If Depo fails to replicate these at lower costs than OEMs, they could lose the AM market. However, Depo is currently a leader in AM LED adoption. **PASS**

---

## STEP 3: FINANCIAL FORTRESS

- **Solvency (D/E Ratio):**  
  - Current: 0.245 (Debt: NT$4,793M / Equity: NT$19,513M)  
  - 5-Year Average: 0.63 (from 2020-2024, showing aggressive debt reduction)

  **Verdict:** **PASS (Current)** / **FAIL (Historical Average)**

- **Cash Conversion (FCF / Net Income):**  
  **Math:**  
  $3,201\text{M (TTM FCF)} / 2,280\text{M (TTM NI)} = 140.4\%$ (Target > 80%)  
  **PASS** [Cash Flow Tab]

- **The "Zero-Revenue" Survival:**  
  Components: `(Cash: 3,386M + ST Inv: 54.5M) / Annual OpEx: ~2,866M`  
  **Result:** 14.4 Months  
  [Balance Sheet Tab]

---

## STEP 4: MANAGEMENT & INTEGRITY

- **Capital Allocation:** (A) Dividends & (B) Debt Reduction. Management has slashed total debt from NT$12.6B (2022) to NT$4.8B (2025) while maintaining a dividend yield of ~5%.

- **Share Count Trend:** **STABLE**.  
  Audit Trail: 165.82M (2020) to 165.82M (2025). CAGR = 0%.  
  **PASS** [Key Statistics Tab]

- **Compensation Alignment:** **DATA NOT FOUND**. (Specific bonus triggers not publicly disclosed in summary filings).

---

## STEP 5: DUAL-VALUATION ENGINE

- **Quality Multiple ($M$):** 15x (Reflecting dominant AM position and expanding margins).

### A. The Li Lu Ratio (ROTIC)
$$
ROTIC = \frac{EBIT}{\text{Total Assets} - \text{Cash} - \text{Goodwill} - \text{NIBCL}}
$$
Audit Trail: 3,410 / (31,494 - 3,386 - 94 - 7,081)  
Result: **16.29\%** (Target > 15%)  
**PASS**

### B. Calculation 1: Strict Valuation (3-Year Average)

- **Strict EBIT:** (2,201 + 2,938 + 3,902) / 3 = NT$3,013M  
- **Intrinsic Value:** `(3,013 \times 15) + (3,386 - 4,793) = NT$43,788M`  
- **Strict Valuation Gap:**  
  $1 - \frac{23,712}{43,788} = 45.8\%$

### C. Calculation 2: Normalized Valuation (Current TTM)

- **Normalized EBIT:** NT$3,410M  
- **Intrinsic Value:** `(3,410 \times 15) + (3,386 - 4,793) = NT$49,743M`  
- **Normalized Valuation Gap:**  
  $1 - \frac{23,712}{49,743} = 52.3\%$

---

## STEP 6: THE RED FLAG GAUNTLET

- **Declining ROIC:** **No**. Improving from 6.6% (2021) to 17.1% (2024).  
- **Acquisition Spree:** **No**. Organic growth dominant.  
- **Capital Intensity:** 40.7% (CapEx ~NT$2.2B / OCF ~NT$5.4B). (Target < 50%)  
  **PASS**

- **Insider Activity:** No material net selling in the last 12 months. **PASS**

## FINAL REPORT OUTPUT

| Ticker        | Verdict  |
|---------------|----------|
| `6605.TW`     | **BUY**|

### Summary Table:

| Metric                         | Value  |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| Strict Valuation Gap           | 45.8%  |
| Margin of Safety               | Yes    |
| Normalized Valuation Gap       | 52.3%  |
| Margin of Safety               | Yes    |
| Financial Fortress Rank        | **EXCELLENT (De-leveraging Complete)** |

---

## The "Anti-Thesis"

A smart seller might argue that the current margin expansion is cyclical, driven by post-COVID supply chain normalization, and that OEMs' move towards integrated "smart headlights" will render the aftermarket too technologically complex for Depo to remain cost-competitive. Additionally, a significant portion of recent gains comes from favorable USD/TWD exchange rates, which may reverse.

---

## The "Fat Pitch" Condition

The current price of NT$143.00 already offers a Strict Valuation Gap of **45.8%**, exceeding the 30% threshold. This represents a rare "Fat Pitch" scenario where a high-quality, de-leveraging market leader trades at a substantial discount to its 3-year average earnings power.

# Strict Li Lu Analysis Framework for Depo Auto Parts Industrial Co., Ltd. (TPE:6605)

**Analysis Date:** December 22, 2025

**Data Sources:** GuruFocus, Investing.com, TSEC Filings, FT Markets.

---

## SECTION 1: BUSINESS MOAT & COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

### Core Business (One Sentence)

* Depo Auto Parts manufactures and distributes aftermarket (AM) and original equipment (OE) automotive lighting systems globally.

### Durable Competitive Advantage - STRICT TEST

* **PASS:** The company possesses a massive library of over 10,000 tooling molds and a global distribution network that creates a high barrier to entry. Smaller competitors cannot afford the R&D or tooling costs to match Depo's SKU depth.
* **Pricing Power:** **YES.** Depo has demonstrated the ability to maintain gross margins above **30%** (currently 31.89%) despite inflationary pressures, indicating an ability to pass costs to the fragmented aftermarket.
* **Moat Trend:** **STABLE.** While its scale is unmatched, the moat is under pressure from OEM patent litigation (e.g., Mercedes-Benz) which challenges the "Repair Clause" in key markets.

---

## SECTION 2: BUSINESS QUALITY & PREDICTABILITY

* **Simple enough to forecast 10 years out?** **YES.** Headlights are a mandatory safety component; demand is driven by car parc age and collision rates, not consumer fashion.
* **Revenues:** **TRANSACTIONAL.** While not subscription-based, the recurring nature of vehicle wear-and-tear and accidents creates "pseudo-recurring" demand.
* **Cyclicality:** **COUNTER-CYCLICAL.** In recessions, consumers keep older cars longer, increasing demand for aftermarket repair parts.
* **Forecast Confidence:** **YES.** Revenue has grown at a 10-year CAGR of 3% with high predictability in cash flow generation.

---

## SECTION 3: FINANCIAL FORTRESS

* **Debt-to-Equity ratio:** **0.25** vs. industry average: **0.64** (Source: Investing.com)
* **PASS:** D/E is significantly below the 0.5 threshold and has declined from 0.86 in 2020.
* **Free Cash Flow positive?** **YES.** FCF has been positive for 10+ consecutive years.
* **Cash conversion rate (FCF/Net Income):** **106%** (2024). **PASS.**
* **Survival Test:** **YES.** With a current ratio of 1.31 and TWD 3.4B in cash, the company can cover interest and operations even with a major revenue hit.

---

## SECTION 4: MANAGEMENT & INTEGRITY DUE DILIGENCE

### Management Team Assessment

* **CEO/Chairman:** Hsu Xu-Ming (Hsu family controlled). Tenure: 20+ years.
* **Track Record:** Successfully transitioned the company from a local manufacturer to a global top-tier AM player with consistent dividend payouts.
* **Red flag (Instability):** **NO.** Management is stable with no frequent C-suite turnover.

### Integrity Check

* **SEC/TSEC Filings:** No recent restatements or auditor disputes reported.
* **Insider Trading:** Significant insider ownership (>30%) aligns interests with shareholders.
* **Related-party transactions:** Standard manufacturing/supply transactions with subsidiaries; no suspicious "leaking" of value detected.

### Lawsuits & Legal Risk

* **Active lawsuits:** **YES.** Depo is in a long-standing patent dispute with **Mercedes-Benz (Mercedes-Benz Group AG)** regarding design patents for headlights.
* **Regulatory risk:** **NO.** No major antitrust investigations active since the 2012 settlement.
* **Verdict:** **YES.** Legal risk is a material threat. If "Repair Clauses" are not upheld in court, Depo could be forced to pay royalties or cease production of specific high-margin models.

---

## SECTION 5: MARKET POSITION & SUSTAINABILITY

### Market Share & Competitive Position

* **Market share:** Estimated **5-7%** of the global AM lighting market (Global leader alongside TYC Brother).
* **Trend:** **STABLE.** Revenue grew from 14.2B (2020) to 20.1B (2024).
* **TAM:** Estimated $30B+ globally for automotive lighting. Penetration is low but stable.
* **Growth runway:** **YES.** EV transition requires more complex, higher-ASP LED and Matrix lighting.

### 10-Year Viability Test

* **Disruption risk:** Low. Even EVs need headlights. ADAS sensors (LiDAR) are being integrated into light housings, which may favor OEs but also raises ASP for Depo.
* **Customer concentration:** Low. Sales are distributed via thousands of wholesalers.
* **Verdict:** **YES.** The company will exist and thrive in 10 years.

## FINAL REPORT OUTPUT

| **Ticker** | **Verdict** |
| --- | --- |
| `TPE:6605` | `AVOID` |

### Summary Table: Strict vs. Normalized Valuation Gap

| **Metric** | **Strict Valuation** | **Normalized Valuation** | **Difference** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EBIT Used | 3,003M | 3,916M | 913M |
| Quality Multiple | 12x | 12x | — |
| Intrinsic Value | 34,608M | 45,564M | 10,956M |

| Valuation Gap | **31.5%** | **47.9%** | 16.4% |
| **Verdict** | **BUY** | **BUY** | **CONTRADICTION** |

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**Is this a Li Lu-style value buy?**

**NO.** Despite excellent financial metrics, a wide margin of safety (31.5%), and a strong moat, the framework mandates an **AVOID** due to Section 8. The ongoing **Mercedes-Benz patent litigation** remains a material risk to the business model's long-term sustainability. Under a strict Li Lu-style "Zero Ambiguity" framework, any threat to the "Repair Clause" and the right to manufacture aftermarket parts is a terminal risk until legally resolved.

---

## INVESTMENT THESIS

Depo is a high-quality, cash-generative industrial compounder trading at a significant discount (31%+) to its earnings power. However, the existential threat posed by OEM design patent litigation creates a "fat-tail" risk that overrides the attractive valuation.

---

## MOAT ASSESSMENT

* **Type:** Economies of scale and distribution depth.
* **Durability:** Strong (Financially) / Weak (Legally).
* **Trend:** Narrowing (due to legal challenges).

---

## RISK/REWARD

* **Upside (5-10 years):** **+100%** (Re-rating to 15x P/E + earnings growth).
* **Downside (if thesis breaks):** **-50%** (Injunctions against selling popular models).
* **Ratio:** 2:1 (Fails the 3:1 target).

---

## ACTION

**AVOID**  
Justification: Material legal litigation regarding core product patents triggers an automatic avoid under the strict framework.
